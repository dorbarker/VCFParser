# TODO List of tasks
- [ ] Bold S-gene linked SNVs in heatmap
- [x] For non-called snvs (i.e. with no-frequency) check for coverage and if coverage is absent annotate as NoCov or NC
- [x] Add colour range (0,0.1) while non-called SNVs will be white - Done
- [x] Remove tsv extension from the sample names - Done
- [x] Add optional frequencies text annotation key
- [x] Make y-axis more squeezed (less space between snv names) - Done
- [x] Sort the heatmap by position as data frame manipulation randomizes snvs (y-axis)
- [x] make color bar legend independent of y-axis length or dyn resized
- [x] Input file with input tsv and bam file pairs and sample name
- [x] Make deletions detections independent of the  actual deleted sequence. Only check for position and length only. Allow accept both viralrecon and iVar
